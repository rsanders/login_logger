LoginLogger v0.1
===========

Login Logger logs any login activity on your site to a table in your database, and also helps protect against abuse, 
by letting you monitor failed logins.

To get started:

1. script/generate login_logger_migration
2. rake db:migrate

This sets up the login_logs table in your DB.

3. add to your SessionsController

include LoginLogger
after_filter :log_login, :only => 'create'

Add this to your User Model:

has_many :login_logs 

Example
===========

Now you can do things like:

Last Time a user logged in:
--
current_user.login_logs.last

Failed Logins in last ten minutes:
--
LoginLog.failed.last_ten_minutes
